            Make sure the version you are reading matches with the version of this instance.

        <dt>
            <a href="{{ url_for('ui:rpsl_update') }}">Object submission</a></dt>
        <dd> to submit updates
            to RPSL objects. This uses the same format as email submissions.
        </dd>
        <dt>
            <a href="/graphql">GraphQL query interface</a></dt>
        <dd>
            This is the newest and most flexible query option, supporting complex RPSL queries
            that can combine any set of criteria and supports related object queries,
            where you can explore the graph of IRR data. RPSL attributes are returned in a
            structured format, which means you do not need to parse RPSL objects in most cases.
        </dd>
        <dt>
            A classic whois query interface on <code>/v1/whois/</code>
        </dt>
        <dd>
            For example, use
            <a href="/v1/whois/?q=!v"><code>/v1/whois/?q=!v</code></a>
            for a whois query for the current version. The queries and output
            are the same as you would run on port 43.

        <h3>Migrating a maintainer</h3>
        <p>
            If you have access to an existing maintainer, you can migrate it
            to IRRD internal authentication, after creating an account:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                You can grant access to other users to edit objects maintained by this maintainer.
            </li>
            <li>
                For each user, you can choose whether they are able to add other users
                and update the maintainer object itself.
            </li>
            <li>
                You can create API keys for your maintainer with limited permissions,
                rather than include your password in emails.
            </li>
            <li>
                This is safer than traditional RPSL authentication, because you can allow users
                or processes to update objects, without allowing them to change the access settings.
            </li>
            <li>
                Logins on this interface can be protected with two-factor authentication.
            </li>
            <li>
                You can submit object updates in this interface after logging in,
                without entering further maintainer passwords.
            </li>
            <li>
                Existing authentication methods will keep working and can be mixed,
                although you are encouraged to remove them.
            </li>
            <li>
                Password hashes are no longer included in RPSL objects.
            </li>
        </ul>
